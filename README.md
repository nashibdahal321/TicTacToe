# TicTacToe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a really cool game that I built using C#! It's a great project for beginners like me to practice C# programming. The game is played on a 3 X 3 grid where two players take turns marking either 'X' or 'O'. By default, the first player will be 'X'.

The rules of the game are simple:
- Only one player can mark their symbol on a square at a time.
- Once a square is marked, it can't be changed by the other player.
- The goal is to get three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
- If no one gets three in a row and all the squares are filled, it's a draw.

I had a lot of fun building this game, and it helped me practice my C# skills. It's a great way to learn about loops, conditionals, and handling user input. I'm proud of what I've accomplished, and I hope you enjoy playing it too! Feel free to give it a try and let me know what you think.
